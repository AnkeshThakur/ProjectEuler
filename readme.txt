For learning purpose I solved few problems from project Euler (http://projecteuler.net/problems). 
Some of them are posted here. I used C language for solving the problem.

Each file is named according to the problem number being solved. For example problem1.c is code for problem number 1.
Every file contains the problem statement at the very begining of the file.
I lost many solved codes. I will add more files as I solve new problems.
